      content="My name is Vibhash Dwivedi. I'm a final year undergraduate currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I am an enthusiastic frontend engineer with expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focus on React for crafting dynamic and responsive user interfaces, and my proficiency extends to full-stack development, particularly within the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Additionally, I have a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms using C++, showcasing a well-rounded skill set encompassing both frontend technologies and essential computer science principles. Keen to contribute to innovative projects, I am poised to thrive in collaborative tech environments and pursue ongoing growth in the dynamic realm of web development."
